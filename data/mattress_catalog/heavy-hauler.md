## Description

Introducing the ALL NEW Heavy Hauler 9-inch Hybrid Mattress. We listened to our customers' feedback and developed a hybrid mattress for the more robust truckers who need more support. The Heavy Hauler gets the job done while providing all the comforts of home.

## Construction (9 inches total)

- **Cover:** Stretch knit Waterfall Cover expertly tailored in-house with a hidden zipper. Attractive basketweave design.
- **2-inch Comfort Foam Layer:** Supportive air technology. Billions of microscopic air capsules that promote air flow and breathability. Supports body while relieving pressure points in heavier sections of the body. Not temperature sensitive, sleeps cooler than traditional memory foam. Alleviates joint and back pain. Isolates motion transfer. Durable.
- **2-inch Supportive Foam Layer:** Phenomenal compression set resistance. Exceptional durability. More support.
- **4-inch Pocket Coil:** Individually wrapped pocket coils firm up as weight compresses them; prevents bottoming out. Sonically welded pocket coils are durable, flex and move independently for support and comfort where needed. Encased with heavy density foam rails for edge support.
- **1-inch Base Foam:** Heavy density foam base for the pocket coils.
